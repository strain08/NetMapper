## NetMapper
Yet another utility to automatically map and unmap network drives.<br />
It will auto map and unmap drive letters based on the share availability.<br />
Or manually if you wish.<br />
<br />

### Notes
Was tested on Win10 22H2. I do not have any Win11 machine available right now.<br />
The utility does not store passwords.<br />
User must connect first to the network share to save password with Windows.
